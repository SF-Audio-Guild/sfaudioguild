                <h3>Become a Contributor</h3>
                <p>Contributors will have the opportunity to prove themselves as "master-sound-designers" by uploading hand-crafted audio assets to our open projects. These will include a variety of entries based on a common theme. Members may contribute up to the total amount expected for any entry on a project.</p>
                <p>When a contribution has been approved, the contributor will receive in-app coins as compensation for their hard-work. We will be using this interaction to vet potential new in-house "Guild Members" for our company.</p>
                <p>The more you make the better the chances we will contact you for contract work.</p>
