    <p>You can earn coins when other members choose to download your uploaded tracks! You can also earn coins by becoming a contributor for SF Audio Guild.</p>
    <p>In order to become a member you will need to read and agree to our <a href='http://sfaudioguild.com/user-license-agreement.pdf' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</a>.</p>

    <h3>Become a Contributor</h3>
    <p>Contributors will have the opportunity to prove themselves as "master-sound-designers" by uploading hand-crafted audio assets to our open projects. These will include a variety of entries based on a common theme. Members may contribute up to the total amount expected for any entry on a project.</p>
    <p>When a contribution has been approved, the contributor will receive in-app coins as compensation for their hard-work. We will be using this interaction to vet potential new in-house "Guild Members" for our company.</p>
    <p>The more you make the better the chances we will contact you for contract work.</p>
